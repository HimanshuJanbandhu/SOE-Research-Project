Attendees:

Arpit Bhatt (IIT2018003),
Himanshu Janbandhu (IIT20180025),
Shivam Chhabra (IIT2018027),
Tarun Asudani (IIT2018028),
Suneet Makkar (IIT2018090).

Agenda
Last Meeting Follow-up:

1. Link Prediction for this metapath has been added . ( A--I--F--I--A ). 
2. Data regarding Commit-hashpath and file paths has also been added in the code.
3. Designed a code which calculates n-grams using strings obtained from summary and description of issues and 
   analyzed different characters using n*n matrix.
4. Analyzed Stanford Topic Modelling Toolkit(TMT),its applications and further use in project.

Notes:
List of all the metapaths used so far:
1.D--B--D
2.D--B--C--B--D
3.D--B--R--B--D
4.D--F--B--F--D
5.D--B--T--B--D--F

Action Items

1. Calculate number of paths for all different metapaths using the algorithm designed.
2. Will be running our algorithm on projects provided.

Arpit Bhatt (IIT2018003),
Himanshu Janbandhu (IIT20180025),
Shivam Chhabra (IIT2018027),
Tarun Asudani (IIT2018028),
Suneet Makkar (IIT2018090).

Agenda
Last Meeting Follow-up:

1. Discussed the designed algorithm to calculate number of paths and its time complexity analysis.
2. Create new toy dataset either from projects like hadoop, archiva or hand drawn dataset for algorithm testing.
3. Calculate number of links between any two different nodes in previous version and now calulate the links
   between same pair of nodes for that metapath in new vesion.  
4. This algorithm should be implemented on various projects .

Notes
* Research Papers are to be read carefully and thoroughly for better understanding.
* We are using sqlite database management system and sqlite files may be converted to css files for further use.
* Project will be implemented in Java and no GUI will be developed.

Action Items
1. Calculate number of paths for all different metapaths using the algorithm designed.
2. Create a new sample dataset in same format as of project for cross verification of designed algorithm..

Next Meeting Agenda:
To train the algorithm using number of paths calculated above and using weka and knime for analyzing links.

Agenda
Last Meeting Follow-up:

1. Discussed the designed algorithm to calculate number of paths and its time complexity analysis.
2. Detailed explanation on how to use different versions of the project 
   and predict links between same developers using different version.
3. Discussion on different correlation coefficients ,how to calculate using MS Excel and their significance in the project.
4. Discuused how to improve algorithms for big data ,use of Breadth first search instead of brute force O(n*n) approach.

2.Collect a toy dataset for cross verification of designed algorithm..

Next Meeting Agenda:
Thorough discusson on vaious machine learning tools like weka and knime and their implementation in the project. 
Use of Pearsons correlation coefficient and how to proceed futher.

Agenda
Last Meeting Follow-up:
1. Discussion about project requirements, and research papers given to us. 
New Business
2. Discussion and in detail explanation of “HeteSim: A General Framework for Relevance
Measure in Heterogeneous Networks”.
3. Discussion of Path based relevance measure algorithm. 
4. Discussion over how to include Heterogeneous graphs in the project, starting from finding and recognising MetaPaths.
 
Notes
* Research Papers are to be read carefully and thoroughly for better understanding. 
* Develop a basic understanding of Databases to start implementation.
* Project will be implemented in Java and no GUI will be developed.

Action Items
1. Connect the sqlite databases to the project, from the dataset given.
2. Code a Heterogenous graph, to start implementation of the project.


Next Meeting Agenda
To start implementation of the project, as a first step - Count the number of various MetaPaths discussed during the meeting provided in the dataset.
